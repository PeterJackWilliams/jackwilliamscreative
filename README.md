Jack Williams Creative Personal Portfolio

This applicaion showcases my videography and video editing work for my freelance business. I used HTML, CSS, to create the framework of the website, and Javascript to implement some creative elements to make the website more interactive, and also to test what I have been learning.

I ran into a few problems linking the JavaScript to interact with the HTML elements, but overcome this with a bit of time. My goal now is to improve the use of JS in this website and other projects, to continue to learn to become more fluent in the language. I am also going to learn react, to take on a new challenge but also to allow me to build scaleable and useable apps.

I tried to keep the CSS as simple as I could from the start, creating more global classes so I didn't have to repeat code. However a couple of times I had to make some CSS more local, as it was effeting other parts of the website. Overall I am very happy with the work I have created, and in the time frame I was able to do it in.
